                <p> In our mechanical system, we wanted a solid, reliable mechanical system, valuing these goals over flash and complexity. Thus we designed a modular system which utilizes a series of human inspired 'fingers' to depress keys on a keyboard. The fingers themselves are connected together in an offset pattern so that the servos can be placed close enough to play three octaves worth of notes, including sharps and flats, and created of simple, easily replaced components. Designing our system in this manner also allowed us to easily scale our system form one to three octaves and if we had had more servos, would have allowed us to expand farther. </p>

                        <p>
                          Our main challenge was fitting the servos close enough together that we are able to play keys adjacent to one another on the keyboard. In order to solve this, we quickly realized that we would have to offset our servos because the width of their casing was too wide. For a single octave, this problem is not too challenging, and can be solved with a single v shape. Adding more octaves, however was more challenging. In order to prevent creating precariously long arms, we had to expand past a single V and redesign some of the arms so that they would be able to pass over servos closer to the piano.

                        <p>
                          Over the course of this project, the design for our mechanical system is what changed the most. When we started, we were very interested in making use a mechanical system called a reciprocating rectilinear which converts continuous rotational motion to bi-directional linear motion. However, after investing a considerable amount of time into this system we realized that the cost in time of making them as well as the difficulty of getting the tolerances correct was higher than we wanted to invest. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          With this decision, we reevaluated our goals for the mechanical system and determined that we valued reliability at that point over a more technically flashy system. This decision, which came reasonably early in the project, allowed us to make our system significantly simpler, more modular, and more easily replicated. All of these factors allowed us not only to meet our minimum deliverable - a system capapble of playing a single octave in the key of C - but to expand to play more than three times as many notes.
